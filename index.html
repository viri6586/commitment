		<h1>Stream of Consciousness</h1>
			<h2>Introducing my friends</h2>
				<p>
			   		My thoughts and ideas will be shared here in a continuous flow. I wanted to paint a picture but maybe I will just show the pictures instead. Below is a picture of my friend I took while she was smelling her flowers. Demi is also one of my closest friends and was actually my boss at one point! We have grown close over the years,

			<h2>Continuing</h2>
				<p>
					Below is an image of my friend Val who is a very good at coding so 	I'll include a picture of her. She has helped me grow my skills in coding and problem solving. Aside from that, she is one of my best friends and my roomate!

			<h2>Another introduction </h2>
				<p>
					I'm going to introduce another friend to the story, her name is Arielle. Arielle has a beautiful doggy whose name I forget. She helped me with my photography project by letting me take her picture. She also talked to me about confdence, and where confidence should come from.
